The last form consists of event and field names\&.  If event name is
omitted, it searches all events for matching field name\&.  The matched
field will be shown only for the event has the field\&.  The event name
supports substring match so user doesn\*(Aqt need to specify full subsystem
and event name everytime\&.  For example, \*(Aqsched:sched_switch\*(Aq event can
be shortened to \*(Aqswitch\*(Aq as long as it\*(Aqs not ambiguous\&.  Also event can
be specified by its index (starting from 1) preceded by the \*(Aq%\*(Aq\&.
So \*(Aq%1\*(Aq is the first event, \*(Aq%2\*(Aq is the second, and so on\&.

When multiple events are sampled, it may not be needed to collect callgraphs for all of them\&. The sample sites are usually nearby, and it\(cqs enough to collect the callgraphs on a reference event\&. So user can use "call\-graph=no" event modifier to disable callgraph for other events to reduce the overhead\&. However, perf report cannot show callgraphs for the event which disable the callgraph\&. This option extends the perf report to show reference callgraphs, which collected by reference event, in no callgraph event\&.

.SH "OVERHEAD CALCULATION"
.sp
The overhead can be shown in two columns as \fIChildren\fR and \fISelf\fR when perf collects callchains\&. The \fIself\fR overhead is simply calculated by adding all period values of the entry \- usually a function (symbol)\&. This is the value that perf shows traditionally and sum of all the \fIself\fR overhead values should be 100%\&.
.sp
The \fIchildren\fR overhead is calculated by adding all period values of the child functions so that it can show the total overhead of the higher level functions even if they don\(cqt directly execute much\&. \fIChildren\fR here means functions that are called from another (parent) function\&.
.sp
It might be confusing that the sum of all the \fIchildren\fR overhead values exceeds 100% since each of them is already an accumulation of \fIself\fR overhead of its child functions\&. But with this enabled, users can find which function has the most overhead even if samples are spread over the children\&.
.sp
Consider the following example; there are three functions like below\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf

\&.ft C
void foo(void) {
    /* do something */
}

void bar(void) {
    /* do something */
    foo();
}

int main(void) {
    bar()
    return 0;
}
\&.ft

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
In this case \fIfoo\fR is a child of \fIbar\fR, and \fIbar\fR is an immediate child of \fImain\fR so \fIfoo\fR also is a child of \fImain\fR\&. In other words, \fImain\fR is a parent of \fIfoo\fR and \fIbar\fR, and \fIbar\fR is a parent of \fIfoo\fR\&.
.sp
Suppose all samples are recorded in \fIfoo\fR and \fIbar\fR only\&. When it\(cqs recorded with callchains the output will show something like below in the usual (self\-overhead\-only) output of perf report:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf

When the \-\-children option is enabled, the \fIself\fR overhead values of child functions (i\&.e\&. \fIfoo\fR and \fIbar\fR) are added to the parents to calculate the \fIchildren\fR overhead\&. In this case the report could be displayed as:
.sp
.if n \{\

.nf

.if n \{\

In the above output, the \fIself\fR overhead of \fIfoo\fR (60%) was add to the \fIchildren\fR overhead of \fIbar\fR, \fImain\fR and \fI__libc_start_main\fR\&. Likewise, the \fIself\fR overhead of \fIbar\fR (40%) was added to the \fIchildren\fR overhead of \fImain\fR and \fI\e_\e_libc_start_main\fR\&.
.sp
So \fI\e_\e_libc_start_main\fR and \fImain\fR are shown first since they have same (100%) \fIchildren\fR overhead (even though they have zero \fIself\fR overhead) and they are the parents of \fIfoo\fR and \fIbar\fR\&.
.sp
Since v3\&.16 the \fIchildren\fR overhead is shown by default and the output is sorted by its values\&. The \fIchildren\fR overhead is disabled by specifying \-\-no\-children option on the command line or by adding \fIreport\&.children = false\fR or \fItop\&.children = false\fR in the perf config file\&.
