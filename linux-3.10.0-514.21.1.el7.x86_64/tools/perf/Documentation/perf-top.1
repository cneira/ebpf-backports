.RE
.PP
\-j, \-\-branch\-filter
.RS 4
Enable taken branch stack sampling\&. Each sample captures a series of consecutive taken branches\&. The number of branches captured with each sample depends on the underlying hardware, the type of branches of interest, and the executed code\&. It is possible to select the types of branches captured by enabling filters\&. For a full list of modifiers please see the perf record manpage\&.

The option requires at least one branch type among any, any_call, any_ret, ind_call, cond\&.
The privilege levels may be omitted, in which case, the privilege levels of the associated
event are applied to the branch filter\&. Both kernel (k) and hypervisor (hv) privilege
levels are subject to permissions\&.  When sampling on multiple events, branch stack sampling
is enabled for all the sampling events\&. The sampled branch type is the same for all events\&.
The various filters must be specified as a comma separated list: \-\-branch\-filter any_ret,u,k
Note that this feature may not be available on all processors\&.

.SH "OVERHEAD CALCULATION"
.sp
The overhead can be shown in two columns as \fIChildren\fR and \fISelf\fR when perf collects callchains\&. The \fIself\fR overhead is simply calculated by adding all period values of the entry \- usually a function (symbol)\&. This is the value that perf shows traditionally and sum of all the \fIself\fR overhead values should be 100%\&.
.sp
The \fIchildren\fR overhead is calculated by adding all period values of the child functions so that it can show the total overhead of the higher level functions even if they don\(cqt directly execute much\&. \fIChildren\fR here means functions that are called from another (parent) function\&.
.sp
It might be confusing that the sum of all the \fIchildren\fR overhead values exceeds 100% since each of them is already an accumulation of \fIself\fR overhead of its child functions\&. But with this enabled, users can find which function has the most overhead even if samples are spread over the children\&.
.sp
Consider the following example; there are three functions like below\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf

\&.ft C
void foo(void) {
    /* do something */
}

void bar(void) {
    /* do something */
    foo();
}

int main(void) {
    bar()
    return 0;
}
\&.ft

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
In this case \fIfoo\fR is a child of \fIbar\fR, and \fIbar\fR is an immediate child of \fImain\fR so \fIfoo\fR also is a child of \fImain\fR\&. In other words, \fImain\fR is a parent of \fIfoo\fR and \fIbar\fR, and \fIbar\fR is a parent of \fIfoo\fR\&.
.sp
Suppose all samples are recorded in \fIfoo\fR and \fIbar\fR only\&. When it\(cqs recorded with callchains the output will show something like below in the usual (self\-overhead\-only) output of perf report:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf

.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
When the \-\-children option is enabled, the \fIself\fR overhead values of child functions (i\&.e\&. \fIfoo\fR and \fIbar\fR) are added to the parents to calculate the \fIchildren\fR overhead\&. In this case the report could be displayed as:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf

          |
          \-\-\- foo
              bar
              main
              __libc_start_main
\&.ft

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
In the above output, the \fIself\fR overhead of \fIfoo\fR (60%) was add to the \fIchildren\fR overhead of \fIbar\fR, \fImain\fR and \fI__libc_start_main\fR\&. Likewise, the \fIself\fR overhead of \fIbar\fR (40%) was added to the \fIchildren\fR overhead of \fImain\fR and \fI\e_\e_libc_start_main\fR\&.
.sp
So \fI\e_\e_libc_start_main\fR and \fImain\fR are shown first since they have same (100%) \fIchildren\fR overhead (even though they have zero \fIself\fR overhead) and they are the parents of \fIfoo\fR and \fIbar\fR\&.
.sp
Since v3\&.16 the \fIchildren\fR overhead is shown by default and the output is sorted by its values\&. The \fIchildren\fR overhead is disabled by specifying \-\-no\-children option on the command line or by adding \fIreport\&.children = false\fR or \fItop\&.children = false\fR in the perf config file\&.
